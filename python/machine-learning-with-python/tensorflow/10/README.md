## Core Learning Algorithms: Hidden Markov Models

### Notes:

- <b>Hidden Markov Models</b>: it works with probabilities to predict future events or states.
  - Example: create a hidden markov model that can predict the weather
  - Reference: https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/HiddenMarkovModel
