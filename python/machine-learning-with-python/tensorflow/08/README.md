## Core Learning Algorithms: Building the Model

### Notes:

- There are hundreds of different classification models we can use that are premade
- The linear classifier was a premade model
- Classifiers:
  - DNNClassifier (Deep Neural Network)
    - DNNClassifier is recommended by Tensorflow to use for classification
  - LinearClassifier
- Build the model (see [main.py](main.py))

### Questions:

What kind of estimator/model does TensorFlow recommend using for classification?

- DNNClassifier
