## Introduction: Machine Learning Fundamentals
### Notes:
- Distinctions in Artifical Intelligence, Machine Learning and Neural Networks
- Artifical Intelligence:
  - The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans
  - How AI has evolved:
    - Can computers think? (this first question was asked)
    - At first, it was only a predefined set of rules that was executed
    - A.I. can be <b>simple or complex</b> (it is still considered A.I.)
    - A simple example would be a ghost in a Pacman game that chases the player
- Machine Learning:
  - It is discussed in the realms of artifical intelligene
  - The first field that "figures out us the rules" for us
  - Data and answers -> machine learning programming -> rules
  - <b>In summary</b>: machine learning is rather than giving the program the rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us
  - Input (layer), set of rules (layer) and output layer
- Neural Networks:
  - It is discussed in the realms of machine learning (but with extended layers)
  - <b>Definition</b>: A form of machine learning that uses a <em>layered representation of data</em>
  - The fact that we have multiple layers (apart from input, rules and output)
  - It is a multi stage information extraction process
  - Our data will be transformed in each layer (layered representation of data)
  - Don't have a predefined set of layers
  - We can differentiate neural networks from machine learning with these layers:
    1. the input data is provided (input information layer)
    2. the data is transformed based on a set of rules (data transformation layer)
    3. the data is extracted (data extraction layer)
    3. combined into some kind of output that is (output layer)
  - It is not modelled based on our brain (despite the similarity in the name in neurons)
- Example:
  - We have the following data:
    - Midterm 1: 70,60,40
    - Midterm 2: 80,90,50
    - Final: 77,84,38
  - Features and labels
  - <b>Features</b>: whatever input information that we have to give to the model to get some output
    - In terms of midterm 2 the midterm 1 and final are the features
  - <b>Label:</b>: What we are trying to predict (the output)
    - In terms of the example, midterm 2 is what we want to predict (the label)

### Questions:
Which statement below is <b>false</b>?
- Neural networks are modeled after the way the human brain works.
