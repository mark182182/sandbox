## Learning the core TensorFlow algorithms
### Notes:
- 4 fundemental machine learning algorithms:
  - Linear regression
  - Classification
  - Clustering
  - Hidden Markov Models
- There are many tools within TensorFlow that can be used to solve problems
- Linear regression:
  - The most basic forms of machine learning and is used to <b>predict numeric values</b>.
  - We want to have a linear correspondence of datapoints
  - Example: predict the survival rate of passengers from the titanic dataset
  - <b>Linear correspondence</b>: when the x value increases, so does the y
  - By drawing the line of best fit, we can predict the values
    - Line of best fit: refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points that best expresses the relationship between those points
    - In 2d that is ```y=m*x+b```

### Questions:
Which type of analysis would be best suited for the following problem?:

You have the average temperature in the month of March for the last 100 years. Using this data, you want to predict the average temperature in the month of March 5 years from now.
