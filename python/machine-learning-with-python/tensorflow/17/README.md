## Convolutional Neural Networks: The Convolutional Layer

### Notes:

- Convnet properties:
  - Input size
  - Filters (32 or 16 or 128)
    - The filters what are going to be trained
  - Sample (size) of the fiters
- Feature map
- Pooling (because of large data)
- Padding section: example: we have a 3x3 sample size and we want it to be on the center and have the output image match the size

### Questions:

What are the three main properties of each convolutional layer?

- Input size, the number of filters, and the sample size of the filters.
