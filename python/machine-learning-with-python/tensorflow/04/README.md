## Core Learning Algorithms: Working with Data
### Notes:
- Focus on exporing, cleaning and selecting appropriate data
- As an example we will use the Titanic dataset
- Load the dataset [main.py](main.py)
- ```pd.read_csv()`` will return to us a new pandas dataframe.
  - A dataframe is like a table and we can actually look at the table representation
- ```.head()``` function can be used to look at the data, it will show the first 5 items in our dataframe
- After analyzing this information, we should notice the following:
  - The manjority of passengers an in their 20's or 30's, are male and in the "Third" class
  - Females have a much higher change of survival

### Questions:
What does the pandas .head() function do?

- By default, shows the first five rows or entries in a data frame.
