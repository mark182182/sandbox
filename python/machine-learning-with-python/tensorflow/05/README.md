## Core Learning Algorithms: Training and Testing Data
### Notes:
- When we train models, we need to sets of data: <b>traning and testing</b>.
- The <b>training</b> data is what we feed to the model, so that it can develop and learn. It is usually a muich larger size than the testing data
- The testing data is what we use to evaluate the model and see how well it is performing. We must separate a set of data that the model has not been trained on to evalute is (to be able to make predictions on new data, that we have never seen before)
- Categorical data:
  - Not numerical data and has to be converted
  - Encode the data to integers, e.g. sex has two values male and female which we encode to 0 and 1
- Numerical data:
  - The data that is provided in a numerical data, that does not need to be encoded

### Questions:
What is categorical data?

- Any data that is not numeric.
