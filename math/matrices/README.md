### Matrices (haven't you learned this already)

Basics:
  - Arrays of mathematical expressions
  - Addition and substraction: [1, 2] + [3, 4] = [4, 6] and [3, 4] - [1, 2] = [2, 2]

Matrix-scalar products:
  - Multiples each element of the matrix by a scalar: 2 * [2, 4] = [4, 8]

Matrix-matrix multiplication:
  - You can only multiple matrices if the number of columns on the left side are equal to the number of rows on the right side
  - Multiplication is not commutative (A*B!=B*A)
  - Multiple the left row with the right column
